# Blossom

Blossom is a graph-based computer programming language, meant to be used with a graphical editor. Blossom is non-deterministic, and uses graphs as its primitve objects.

This repository serves as a home for the specification of Blossom, and will keep track of example Blossom programmes that are useful or interesting, and will keep a list of any implementations of Blossom.
